Original idea and code for this project is found [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/6jqgno/longexposure_simulation_80_seconds_at_60fps) 
This project is put together with the intention to make the code easier 
to setup and use. 

Special thanks to [Unsynsored](https://www.twitch.tv/unsynsored) for the 
project idea.
